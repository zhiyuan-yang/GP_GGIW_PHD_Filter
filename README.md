This repo contains code for paper [Gaussian Process Gaussian Mixture PHD Filter for 3D Multiple Extended Target Tracking](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/13/3224). 

We propose the Gaussian process Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GP-PHD) filter, which is capable of tracking multiple extended targets with complex shapes in the presence of clutter.
